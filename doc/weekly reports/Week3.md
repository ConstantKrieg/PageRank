# Week 3

## Things I did

This week I finalized the data structures that are needed for graphs and created a generator to make them.
I also read theory about the PageRank algorithm and tried to come up with different solutions on what would be the best way to implement it. 
I created a class for the algorithm and started to make different pieces of it. 

## What I learned
I didn't code that much this week, because I was mainly focusing on learning the theory behind different PageRank implementations.
So mostly everything I learned was the theory behind it and some different ways to implement graphs.
