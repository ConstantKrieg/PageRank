# Week 4

## Things I did

I created a simple case of the PageRank algorithm. Currently the algorithm does not take weight of the edges in to account and only gives the pagerank to the nodes without sorting them.
I also created some math tools manually like floor and round functionality
## What I learned
I learned much about the PageRank itself. Most of the job was pretty straight forward, still needed to debug a bit before getting the algorithm to work.
