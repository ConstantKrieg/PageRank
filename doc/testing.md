# Testing

This project only contains basic level unit testing for now. 

A graph is manually created in the test or randomly generated and that is passed to the PageRanker.

After completing the PageRank, tests validate that the PageRank finished correctly with a combined value of 1.


Plan is to have some 3rd party library to generate graphs and then give them to pagerank. Performance of PageRank is then evaluated. 
As the functionality is now done this, is the main focus from now on.
